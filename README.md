# ART_TO_RNN

An Adaptive Resonance Theory model that feeds into multiple RNN models. This is the first pass at building how I intuitively understand the striate cortex (or any low level input layers) and the following process of passing that information to appropriate, learned executive functions (RNN's) that are most suited for the specific input.  The ART model acts as a real time memory and recognition engine that is stable and elastic; able to recognize information that it 'remembers' as well as learn new information without disrupting prior memories.  The RNN's are trained and associated with these ART memories and saved to a static 'memory' to be used on demand when ART encounters a memory but needs further processing.
